      ```

    - Run `npm run start` from the project directory to start the bot.

### Bot Permissions

When invited to a server, the bot creates a `@<bot-name>` role.

- Position this role above others that it will manage and below any sensitive roles.
- Give the `@<bot-name>` role these permissions:
    - Manage Roles
    - Manage Nicknames

## Features

### Auto-Tracking

- **Updates**: Automatically refreshes WOM group data nightly at midnight (AEST).

### Reactions

- Reacts with ðŸ«¡ to all messages sent in the ``#ðŸ¥³-âŠ±newcomers`` channel
  
### Role Management

- **Sync Interval**: Synchronizes roles from the WOM group every ``5 minutes``.
- **Nickname Lookup**: Matches Discord nicknames to WOM group data. If the user has multiple RSNs (separated using any of `/&|`),
  the highest rank is assigned.
- **Role Assignment**: Assigns roles based on WOM rank names (e.g., `@Recruit`).
    - Automatically creates roles if they don't exist.
- **Exclusions**: Does not assign ranks of `Saviour`, `Deputy Owner`, or `Owner`.
- **Fallback Role**: Assigns `@guest` for users not found in the WOM group.

### Commands

- **Set RSN**: `/rsn <your-rsn>` sets the supplied rsn as the users nickname in the server, facilitating role
  synchronization.

### Status Updates

- **Frequency**: Changes the bot's status every minute with random stat from the clan.
- **Data Refresh**: Fetches new data from the WiseOldMan API every 6 hours.
